  "🍿 Netflix Landing Page Recreation Project 🎬✨  Dive into the world of web development with my latest project – a recreated Netflix landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌐💻  Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic features, I've meticulously crafted a visually stunning and responsive landing page. From the seamless navigation bar to the dynamic content carousel, every element is designed to mirror the aesthetic appeal and functionality of the original Netflix platform.
